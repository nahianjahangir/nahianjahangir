### Hi, I'm Nahian 👋🏾

I'm a Product Manager who uses a fusion of analytics and user empathy to develop products. I strive to build impactful features and iterate upon them so they can continue to serve my customers and grow the business. 

- 💡 I’m currently working on building a portfolio website and writing posts/articles on my career experiences (so far)
- 🌱 So far, I've gotten back into learning more about Natural Language Processing and how to apply it
- 💬 You can talk to me about how great the Across the Spiderverse movie was :D
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- 👾 Fun fact: I love reading manga, playing video games, learning how to draw, and dancing
